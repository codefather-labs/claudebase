# Releasing `claudebase`

This document describes how to cut a release of the `claudebase` CLI binary.
It is owned by the maintainers of `claude-code-sdlc` and is **independent** of
the SDLC repo's own release process.

> **Important — release-engineer invariance:** the SDLC repo's
> `release-engineer` (now invoked via the user-driven `/release` slash command,
> not as a `/merge-ready` gate) is **UNCHANGED** by this pipeline. The
> `claudebase` binary follows its own tag scheme, its own GitHub Actions
> workflow, and its own versioning cadence. Do not couple them. (Historical
> note: in iter-1/iter-2 release-engineer ran as Gate 9 of `/merge-ready`;
> the iter-3.x extraction to `/release` made it user-invoked but did not
> change its packaging logic.)

## 1. Tag scheme

Tags use the form:

```
claudebase-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>
```

For example: `claudebase-v0.1.0`, `claudebase-v0.2.0`,
`claudebase-v1.0.0`.

This is **independent** from the SDLC release tags (which the SDLC repo
publishes for its install-script / agent-set releases). The two tag namespaces
do not overlap and are not synchronized.

The release workflow is triggered automatically when any tag matching
`claudebase-v*` is pushed to the repository (see
`.github/workflows/claudebase-release.yml`).

---

## 2. Maintainer-only one-time bootstrap

Before the SDLC release that introduces the local-knowledge-base feature
merges to `main`, a maintainer **must** cut the very first
`claudebase-v0.1.0` tag manually. This is required so that subsequent
users of `install.sh` (which downloads the prebuilt binary) find a published
release to download — per FR-11.3 / AC-13.

This step is performed exactly **once** in the lifetime of the project. After
the first tag is published, every subsequent release is just step 3 below.

### One-time bootstrap procedure

From a clean checkout of `main` at the commit that introduces this feature:

1. Verify `claudebase/Cargo.toml` declares `version = "0.1.0"`.
2. Verify the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/claudebase-release.yml`.
3. Cut and push the first tag:
   ```bash
   git tag claudebase-v0.1.0
   git push origin claudebase-v0.1.0
   ```

   **Iter-3 alternative (recommended for v0.2.0 and later first-tag bootstraps):**
   `bash install.sh --bootstrap-release 0.2.0` runs a 7-part pre-condition
   gate (clean tree, on main, codefather-labs origin, Cargo.toml version
   match, no existing tag local/remote, gh CLI authenticated,
   `.claude/release-notes-0.2.0.md` non-empty), prompts default-deny
   `[y/N]` (or auto-confirms when `AUTO_RELEASE=1` / non-TTY), pushes the
   tag with rollback-on-failure, and never uses `--force`. See
   `install.sh` `bootstrap_release()` for the full implementation.
4. Open the **Actions** tab on GitHub and watch the
   `claudebase release` workflow complete. You should see:
   - the `actionlint` job pass,
   - 4 parallel `build (<platform>)` jobs pass,
   - the `release` job create the GitHub Release.
5. Open the **Releases** page and verify all 4 artifacts are attached:
   - `claudebase-darwin-arm64`
   - `claudebase-darwin-x64`
   - `claudebase-linux-x64`
   - `claudebase-linux-arm64`
6. (Optional but recommended) On a host matching one of the four platforms,
   download the corresponding artifact, mark it executable, and run
   `./claudebase --version` to confirm it starts.

Only after these steps complete is it safe to merge the SDLC release that
references the binary from `install.sh`.

## 3. Version-bump rules (semver)

`claudebase` follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

| Change                                              | Bump  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Backward-incompatible CLI / on-disk format change   | MAJOR |
| Additive feature (new subcommand, new flag, etc.)   | MINOR |
| Bug fix or internal refactor with no surface change | PATCH |

Concretely, when releasing:

1. Update `version` in `claudebase/Cargo.toml`.
2. Run `cargo build --release -p claudebase --manifest-path claudebase/Cargo.toml`
   locally to regenerate `Cargo.lock` and verify the build is clean.
3. Commit the version bump with a `chore(core): bump claudebase to vX.Y.Z`
   commit (or equivalent under the project's conventional-commit scopes).
4. Cut and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag claudebase-vX.Y.Z
   git push origin claudebase-vX.Y.Z
   ```
5. The release workflow will run automatically.

**Iter-3 alternative — automated via `release-engineer` §7 executing mode:**
when this repo's `.claude/rules/auto-release.md` sentinel is present (it is,
as of iter-3 where the SDLC core opted in), `/release` runs the tag-creation
and push steps itself per the §7 4-tier authority dispatch. The maintainer's
responsibility shrinks to: ensure `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` is
populated and run `/release` on a clean main checkout. `/release`
disambiguates the tag scheme based on whether `claudebase/` was
changed (claudebase-v* scheme) or not (bare v* scheme); if both, the
agent prompts for explicit user choice. The Sensitive-tier
`git push origin <tag>` step still prompts default-deny
`[y/N]` unless `AUTO_RELEASE=1` is set in the environment.

---

## 4. Artifact verification

Each release attaches one binary per supported platform. Verification covers:

### Size budget (≤ 10 MB) — NFR-1.1

The release workflow asserts `size <= 10485760` (10 MiB) as a hard gate per
NFR-1.1. A build that exceeds the budget fails the workflow and no release is
cut. If you hit the limit:

- inspect what crates expanded (e.g., `cargo bloat --release` locally),
- confirm `Cargo.toml`'s release profile still has `strip = true`, `lto = true`,
  `codegen-units = 1`,
- consider feature-gating heavy dependencies.

### Smoke test (`--version`)

Each matrix job runs the freshly-built binary with `--version` and requires
exit code 0. This catches dynamic-linker mismatches, missing transitive
runtime symbols, or accidental panics on startup that a unit test wouldn't
catch.

### sha256 sidecar — **deferred to iter-2**

Publishing per-artifact `*.sha256` sidecar files for users to verify download
integrity is on the iter-2 follow-up list (see §6 below). For iter-1, users
rely on GitHub's TLS-served release URLs and the size assertion baked into
the workflow.

---

## 5. Per-release checklist

Once the bootstrap (§2) is done, every subsequent release is:

- [ ] `Cargo.toml` `version` bumped per §3.
- [ ] `Cargo.lock` regenerated and committed.
- [ ] Tag pushed: `git push origin claudebase-vX.Y.Z`.
- [ ] GitHub Actions `claudebase release` workflow completes green.
- [ ] All 4 binary artifacts visible on the Releases page.
- [ ] At least one platform's binary spot-checked with `--version`.

---

## 6. Iter-2 follow-ups

These items are explicitly out of scope for iter-1 and are tracked here for
the next iteration:

- **sha256 sidecar files.** Publish `<artifact>.sha256` alongside each binary
  and document the verification command (`sha256sum -c`) in `install.sh`.
- **Sigstore / cosign signing.** Sign each artifact with sigstore's
  keyless-signing flow and publish the signature + certificate sidecars.
- **Windows builds.** Add `windows-latest` (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) to the
  build matrix. iter-1 deliberately ships unix-only because the consumer
  surface (`install.sh`) is bash-only in iter-1.
- **Provenance attestations** (SLSA / GitHub-Attestations) so downstream
  consumers can verify the artifact was produced by this exact workflow run.

---

## 7. Relationship to the SDLC release pipeline

To restate plainly: this workflow has **nothing to do with** the SDLC repo's
own `release-engineer` agent or its `/release` slash command. The
release-engineer is **UNCHANGED** by the introduction of the
local-knowledge-base feature.

- The SDLC repo's `release-engineer` runs on user-invoked `/release` (NOT in
  `/merge-ready` — extracted to its own command in iter-3.x) and is
  responsible for the SDLC's own release cadence (CHANGELOG, install.sh
  versioning, agent-set tag).
- The `claudebase` binary has its own lifecycle, its own tag scheme, its
  own GitHub Release page, and its own version number.
- A new SDLC release does **not** require a new `claudebase` release.
- A new `claudebase` release does **not** require a new SDLC release.

The only coupling is the one-time bootstrap (§2): the very first
`claudebase-v0.1.0` tag must exist before the SDLC release that wires
`install.sh` to download it can merge.

## pdfium-render dependency (iter-2)

The `claudebase` binary loads `libpdfium.{dylib,so,dll}` at runtime via the `pdfium-render = "0.9"` Rust crate. The library itself is NOT statically linked — it's downloaded by `install.sh` from `bblanchon/pdfium-binaries` GitHub Releases (tag `chromium/<version>`) and placed at `~/.claude/tools/claudebase/pdfium/lib/libpdfium.{dylib,so}`.

### Caret semver fence

`Cargo.toml` declares `pdfium-render = "0.9"`. This caret semver constraint resolves to `>=0.9.0, <0.10.0` — patch-version updates are picked up automatically for security fixes within the 0.9 line, but major-version bumps are blocked.

To upgrade past `0.9.x`:
1. Open the new release's CHANGELOG and identify breaking API changes
2. Update `claudebase/src/pdf.rs` to match the new API (typically the `Pdfium::bind_to_library`, `load_pdf_from_byte_slice`, `pages()`, `text()` calls)
3. Update `Cargo.toml` to the new version
4. Run `cargo test --release` and verify no regressions
5. Bump `KNOWLEDGE_PDFIUM_VERSION` in `install.sh` to a corresponding bblanchon tag (the chromium/<int> versions track Chrome releases; pdfium-render docs note compatibility)
6. Re-test install.sh smoke flow on darwin-arm64 (and ideally other platforms via CI)

### KNOWLEDGE_PDFIUM_VERSION bump

To upgrade pdfium binary alone (without changing the Rust bindings):
1. Visit `https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases` and pick a recent stable tag like `chromium/7300`
2. Edit `install.sh` line `KNOWLEDGE_PDFIUM_VERSION="chromium/<old>"` to the new tag
3. Edit `.github/workflows/claudebase-release.yml` `PDFIUM_VERSION:` env var to match
4. Run `bash install.sh --yes --local` to fetch the new binary
5. `cargo test --release` smokes against the new pdfium

### Fixture stress note (architect action item #4)

`claudebase/tests/fixtures/calibre-sample.pdf` is a 2-page calibre-converted excerpt; size budget was raised from 100 KB to 200 KB during planning to accommodate calibre's font-subset embedding. Current fixture is ~72 KB. If a future calibre-converted fixture exceeds 100 KB, that's expected — calibre embeds substantial subset fonts. The 200 KB ceiling is the hard fence.

## Telegram Multi-CLI Cutover

Before releasing a version that includes the `telegram-multi-cli` feature, and before decommissioning the per-CLI `telegram-plugin-rs` on any existing deployment, follow these steps in order. **Do not skip Step 0.**

### Step 0 — Verify the daemon is running (mandatory gate)

**Step 0 (mandatory gate):** Verify `claudebase daemon status` returns `running` AND the service-manager registration (launchd on macOS / systemd on Linux / SCM on Windows) is active. If not, run:

```
claudebase daemon install
claudebase daemon start
```

**DO NOT proceed to stopping the plugin until `claudebase daemon status` shows `running`.** Stopping the plugin before the daemon is active leaves the bot with no poller — Telegram messages are silently dropped until either the plugin is restarted or the daemon comes up. This gate is the F-3 mandatory pre-condition that prevents the inert-and-silent failure mode.

### Step 1 — Stop the legacy per-CLI Telegram plugin

Once the daemon is confirmed running, stop the per-CLI plugin that previously held the `getUpdates` polling slot. How to stop it depends on how it was started:

- If it was launched via `claudebase run` (the exec wrapper): kill or stop the `claude` process that was started with the Telegram channel preset.
- If it was installed as a Claude Code plugin: disable or remove it via `claude plugin` commands, or stop the process that is running it.

**Confirm the plugin is no longer polling** by checking that no `plugin:telegram` process is running. The daemon's log will show:

```
telegram getUpdates conflict cleared — daemon poller now owns the bot
```

when the next successful poll completes after the plugin stops.

### Step 2 — Confirm `[telegram] enabled = true` in daemon.toml

The default value is `true`, so this step is a no-op for a fresh install. For operators who previously set `enabled = false` as a precaution, ensure the flag is either absent or explicitly set to `true` in `daemon.toml` before continuing.

### Step 3 — Verify the daemon owns the bot

Send a test message to the bot from Telegram. The message should arrive as `source="claudebase"` in the daemon logs (not `source="plugin:telegram:telegram"`). If the daemon is the sole poller, you will see the message routed to the bound CLI.

You can also confirm with `/agents` — the bot should reply listing the connected CLI instances.

### Step 4 — Revert path (if needed)

To fall back to the legacy per-CLI plugin:

1. Set `[telegram] enabled = false` in `daemon.toml`.
2. Restart the daemon: `claudebase daemon restart`.
3. Restart the per-CLI plugin (or re-run `claudebase run` with the Telegram channel preset).

The daemon will no longer poll `getUpdates`; the plugin takes over. No code changes are required.

## Facts

### Verified facts
- Workflow path `.github/workflows/claudebase-release.yml` is the file produced in this same Slice 4 commit — source: `.claude/plan.md` lines 240-244 (Slice 4 Files declaration) and Slice 4 implementation prompt.
- Crate package name is `claudebase`, version `0.1.0`, manifest at `claudebase/Cargo.toml` — source: `claudebase/Cargo.toml:1-6` Read this session.
- NFR-1.1 size budget is 10 MB (10485760 bytes) — source: `.claude/plan.md` line 244 (Slice 4 Changes) and line 258 (Done-when condition).
- Slices 1, 2, 3 are complete with the Rust crate fully functional (ingest, search, list, status, delete) — source: Slice 4 implementation prompt context paragraph.
- release-engineer invariance is mandated by FR-12.4 / PRD §11.7 item 5 — source: `.claude/plan.md` line 245 (Slice 4 Changes, RELEASING.md item (e)). (Iter-1/2 framed this as "Gate 9 invariance"; iter-3.x extraction to /release preserves the same invariance under a different invocation surface.)
- Maintainer one-time bootstrap of `claudebase-v0.1.0` is required by FR-11.3 / AC-13 — source: `.claude/plan.md` line 245 (Slice 4 Changes, RELEASING.md item (b)).

### External contracts
- `actions/checkout@v4` — symbol: action major version `v4` — source: GitHub Actions marketplace standard usage in current ecosystem — verified: no — assumption (action exists and major-version pin is the canonical reference; risk: if v4 is removed/yanked, the lint+build jobs fail with a clear actionlint or runtime error and we bump to v5).
- `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` — symbol: tag `stable` selects current stable Rust — source: dtolnay/rust-toolchain README convention — verified: no — assumption (the `@stable` tag is the action's documented entry point; risk: if the action's API changes the toolchain step fails fast in CI before any artifact is uploaded).
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` — symbol: action major version `v4` with `name`, `path`, `if-no-files-found`, `retention-days` inputs — source: GitHub-published v4 input schema, standard usage — verified: no — assumption (inputs match v4 contract; risk: input rename causes the upload step to fail in CI on first run, fixable by aligning to actual v4 inputs).
- `actions/download-artifact@v4` — symbol: action major version `v4` with `path` input downloading all artifacts to subdirectories — source: GitHub-published v4 behavior — verified: no — assumption (multi-artifact download lays out one subdir per artifact name; risk: layout mismatch causes the `softprops/action-gh-release` `files:` glob to miss files, fixable by adjusting glob).
- `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` — symbol: action major version `v2` with `tag_name`, `name`, `files`, `fail_on_unmatched_files` inputs — source: action README convention — verified: no — assumption (inputs match v2 contract; risk: if the action drops `fail_on_unmatched_files` the release step still runs but silently uploads fewer files; mitigated by §5 manual checklist requiring 4 artifacts on the release page).
- `rhysd/actionlint@v1` — symbol: action major version `v1` with `files` input — source: action README convention — verified: no — assumption (inputs match v1 contract; risk: misconfigured input causes lint job to fail loudly, gating the matrix as designed).
- GitHub-hosted runner labels `macos-14`, `macos-13`, `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-22.04-arm` — symbol: runner image labels — source: `.claude/plan.md` line 244 (Slice 4 Changes prescribes these verbatim per architect decision) — verified: yes (load-bearing per architect; pinned literally as required).
- Rust target triples `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` — symbol: rustc built-in target triples — source: standard rustc tier-1/tier-2 target triple naming, also referenced verbatim in Slice 4 implementation prompt — verified: yes (these are stable, long-published Rust target identifiers).

### Assumptions
- The `dist/<artifact-name>/<artifact-name>` layout produced by `actions/download-artifact@v4` matches the `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` `files:` glob. Risk: if the layout differs the release job fails on `fail_on_unmatched_files: true`, surfacing immediately. How to verify: first invocation via §2 bootstrap procedure — the maintainer watches the workflow and confirms 4 artifacts attach.
- The `cargo build` step is sufficient on `ubuntu-22.04-arm` without an explicit cross toolchain because the runner is natively aarch64. Risk: if the runner image is not actually aarch64-native, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` requires `cross` or a toolchain image and the build fails fast. How to verify: bootstrap run reveals the truth on first push of `claudebase-v0.1.0`.
- `stat -f%z` (BSD) vs `stat -c%s` (GNU) covers all 4 runners. Risk: if a future runner image changes its stat flavor the assertion errors out clearly with `stat: illegal option`, not silently. How to verify: bootstrap run.

### Open questions
- (none) — all decisions for Slice 4 are documented; sha256, sigstore, Windows are explicitly tracked under §6 iter-2 follow-ups and are out of scope.
